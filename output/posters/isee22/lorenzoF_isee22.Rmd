# Background & Objectives

* Individuals are exposed to multiple environmental pollutants with endocrine disrupting activity (endocrine disruptors, EDCs)
* Few studies have integrated multiple omic layers, especially in a child cohort
* We aimed to identify multi-omic signatures associated with childhood exposure to non-persistent EDCs using a network approach

# Methods

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/design.png")
```

* Data: HELIX (Human Early-Life Exposome) Child Panel Study
* Exposures: 22 non-persistent EDCs (10 phthalate, 7 phenol, and 5 organophosphate pesticide metabolites) with repeated measures
* Multi-omic profiles: methylome, serum and urinary metabolome, proteome

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/methods.png")
```

* We developed Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs) based on shrinkage estimates of pairwise partial correlations between EDCs and molecular features in each week
* The obtained networks for the two visits were merged in order to identify reproducible associations
* We corroborated the associations between EDCs and omic features with
  * Manual literature review (PubMed)
  * Adverse health effects associated with the EDCs (PubChem)
  * Traits associated with the CpG sites (EWAS Atlas)
  * Genes mapped to the CpG sites (EWAS Atlas, EWAS Catalog)

## Merged network: reproducible associations across visits

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/networks_main.svg")
```

* The process of network merging led to the exclusion of a significant number of edges, maintaining 950 edges compared to 4,083 and 4,908 in networks A and B, respectively

| Chemical class | Compound | Omic layer | Omic feature | Median pcor | Biological interpretation |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| OP pesticides | DEP | Serum metabolome | Serotonin | 0.052 | Exposure to pesticides linked to changes in the serotonergic system |
| Phenols | TRCS | Serum metabolome | Serotonin | -0.055 | Possible association between personal care product ingredients and serotonin |
| Phthalates | oh-MiNP | Serum metabolome | Kynurenine | -0.056 | Possible mediating effect of quinolic acid  on exposure to phthalates and neurological disorders |
| Phenols | TRCS | Proteome | Leptin | -0.066 | Effect of mixtures of phenols and parabens |

# Conclusions

* We employed an integrative method to investigate reproducible associations across time points between non-persistent EDCs and multi-omic profiles in a child cohort
* Strengths: repeated pooled samples of urines across each week; reproducible and quantifiable measurements of the metabolome
* Limitations: relatively small sample size; residual confounding
* Some of these biological signatures point towards the potential biological effects of OP pesticide and phthalate metabolites on the nervous system
* Among the most significant, we found associations between diethyl phosphate and serotonin, triclosan and serotonin, mono‑4‑methyl‑7‑hydroxyoctyl phthalate and kynurenine, triclosan and leptin
